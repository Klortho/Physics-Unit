', '=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document lists the units provided by L<Physics::Unit> sorted by name.
Since the POD standard does not do tables, they are formatted as HTML
tables, therefore this is best viewed in a browser-based POD renderer.
Note that the L<physics-unit> script can produce a very similar HTML file
in the location of your choosing should this be more convenient.
