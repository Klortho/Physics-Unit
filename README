Physics/Unit version 0.51
=========================

This tarball includes the following modules
  Physics::Unit
  Physics::Unit::Scalar
  Physics::Unit::Scalar::Implementation - pod docs
  Physics::Unit::Script
  Physics::Unit::Script::GenPages
  Physics::Unit::Implementation - pod docs

Objects of class Physics::Unit define units of measurement that correspond
to physical quantities.  This module allows you to manipulate these units,
generate new derived units from other units, and convert from one unit
to another.  Each unit is defined by a conversion factor and a
dimensionality vector.

Objects of type Physics::Unit::Scalar store physical quantities.  Each
instance of a class that derives from Physics::Unit::Scalar holds the value
of some type of measurable quantity.  When you use this module, several new
classes are immediately available.  See the Derived Classes section of the
documentation for a complete list

The module Physics::Unit::ScalarSubtypes defines several classes that
derive from Physics::Unit::Scalar, each corresponding to a different
physical quantity.
