Physics/Unit version 0.04_02
=========================

This tarball includes four modules:
  Physics::Unit
  Physics::Unit::Scalar
  Physics::Unit::ScalarSubtypes
  Physics::Unit::Vector

It also includes two modules which only include documentation
(implementation notes):
  Physics::UnitImpl
  Physics::Unit::ScalarImpl

Objects of class Physics::Unit define units of measurement that correspond
to physical quantities.  This module allows you to manipulate these units,
generate new derived units from other units, and convert from one unit
to another.  Each unit is defined by a conversion factor and a
dimensionality vector.

Objects of type Physics::Unit::Scalar store physical quantities.  Each
instance of a class that derives from Physics::Unit::Scalar holds the value
of some type of measurable quantity.  When you use this module, several new
classes are immediately available.  See the Derived Classes section of the
documentation for a complete list

The module Physics::Unit::ScalarSubtypes defines several classes that
derive from Physics::Unit::Scalar, each corresponding to a different
physical quantity.

Objects of class Physics::Unit::Vector hold vector quantities.  This
module is still in an embryonic stage.
